# 5G-RFsim-Docker-powered-OAI-RF-Simulator

A fully containerized setup for running the OpenAirInterface 5G RF simulator.
This project allows you to emulate a complete 5G network—including the Core, gNB, and NR-UE—entirely in Docker, without the need for any physical hardware.
It's ideal for developing, testing, and learning about 5G networks.
